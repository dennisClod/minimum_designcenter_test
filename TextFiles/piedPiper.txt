The company was formed in 2014 by Richard Hendricks as a company to develop Richard's algorithm 
that he'd created. The company is best known to for achieving the highest Weissman score in history 
during their presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt. The company's first appearance was in the Season One 
episode Minimum Viable Product and has since served as the primary company for the series.

creates in his spare time an app called Pied Piper that contains a revolutionary data compression algorithm. 
Peter Gregory acquires a stake in Pied Piper, and Richard hires the residents of Erlich Bachman's business 
incubator, including Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai, along with Jared Dunn, who also defected from Hooli. 
Meanwhile Richard's best friend, Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti, chooses to accept a substantial promotion at 
Hooli instead, despite his lack of merit for the job.
